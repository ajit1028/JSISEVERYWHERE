/*
    RAM store data inside it on the temporary basis.
    you have haeard of GB(10^9 bytes) that is giga bytes.
    ex: 2GB -> 2 * 10^9 bytes
        1byte -> 8 bits
        RAM is collections of bytes and byte is a collection of bits. bit is made up of  transistor(npm and npn) either 1 or 0.
        that's why RAM contains only 1 and 0. 


   Datatypes: Datatype is a convertor that converts real world data(which is not in the binary ie. 12, 1.22, "Ajs", Yes,movie,song etc) into the binary
             so that it can store into the RAM.
