Host: Any device(usually a computer) connected to a network. It can send or receive data.Every device with an IP Address
(like your phone,tab,computer is a host).

Server: A special type of host â€” it's a computer designed to provide services or resources (like websites, files, or data) to other hosts called clients.

Server is also a computer.

A browser (short for web browser) is a software application used to access and view websites on the internet.
Popular browsers include Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, and Microsoft Edge.
They retrieve content from web servers and display it to users, handling HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and more.

Browser contains Address Bar where you search for url,Tabs like you open multiple webpage, Main content area display of a web page,back/forward buttons. 

JavaScript is everywhere.

Rendering is the process to show data on your UI that is coming as a responce from the server in the form of html and css.

Client - Server Architecture:-> Let's understand these concept with the help of a simple example.Everyone here have 
                                 use swiggy app. You type swiggy in your browser for ordering food. Then what happend 
                                 a request is send from your computer(client) to the swiggy server that is kept in other 
                                 place it receives the request and give html or css or html+css files as a resoponce
                                 for your request that render on your UI.
                                 Let's suppose you are thinking to order pizza for you then at that time you friend come and tell you
                                 to order for him also then you click on add(+) button for two pizza. Then what you think will the  request
                                 will also go to the server for when you click add(+) buttons or its handle by browser only?
                                 Let me ans you its handle on the browser by itself using a famous beautiful programming language know as 
                                 JAVASCRIPT. JavaScript is everywhere. 
                                 This phenomenon from getting sending request and getting responce is known as client server architecture.
                                 

                            

Every browser has its own javascript engine. Chrome has V8,Mozilla has spidermonkey like this Safari has its own etc.
You can see gthe code using inspect buttons on your browser it will show code.
