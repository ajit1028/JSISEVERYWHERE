Microprocessor, MLL, Assembler, ASL, Compiler, HLL
 A computer basically have some harware componenets namely microprocessor, haad disk, ram ,gpu.
 Out of all these devices that is brain of coumpter because of which we can listing songs, moving mouse and all the operations are performed by micro processor.
 intel i3,i5,i7, m1,m2 chips are called microprocessor.
 microprocessor are made up of technolgy called as semiconductor and microprocessor is made up of transistors.
 transistors are of two type npn or pnp. transistors capable of storing one and only
 one thing inside it that is voltage. in voltage only two states are there either +5V or 0V.
 Utlimately a microprocessor is made of transistors and transistors store only either +5V or 0V.
 microprocessor is only understanding of voltage.
 +5V represents 1 and 0V represents 0.

 microprocessor only understand 0 and 1 that is known as binary or machine level language.
 Collections of instructions is known as program and process of creating the program is called programming and the one who is writing codes n all
 is known as programmer or coder.
 
 microprocessor can only understand binary(0 and  1) that is also known as machine level language(MLL).
MLL was hard to understand for the programer the  after they use ADD,MUL,SUB,DIV these are known as nemonics and using these
are called assembly level language(ALL).

but microprocessor only knows machine level language so is can't understand ASL so we need a translator for that that is 
known as assembler(Software) that convert ASL -> MSL that microprocessor understand.

then after sometimes it was find that even ASL was hard then they think about to use some easy thing fot that then they 
started using english words and symbols for that that is known as High Level Language(HLL).
and again problem creates because of computer understanad only MLL then complier(Software) comes into the picture and
that conerts HLL -> MLL that microprocessor understand.
All of the modern days language like Java,JavaScript, c++,c,python,kotlin is known as HLL.
